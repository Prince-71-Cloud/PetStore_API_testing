## Description:
This repository contains API tests for the PetStore API using Postman and Newman, with continuous integration (CI) setup through Jenkins. The tests validate various functionalities of the API, ensuring that the endpoints are working correctly. The tests include requests for user creation, product handling, and order management, with assertions for status codes, response times, and data validation.

The integration with Jenkins automates the execution of Postman tests as part of a CI pipeline, enabling continuous testing of the API whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Features:
